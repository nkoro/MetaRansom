# MetaRansom
Explainable Metaverse Ransomware Detection using SHAP


Ransomware attacks are the most severe attacks because they rupture the (confidentiality, integrity and availability) CIA triad of users or organizations. In order to actualize realtime detection of ransomware, this experiment classifies ransomware attacks/
behavior through their network traffic flow features.

The dataset used for this experiment and paper is the 2022 EdgeIIoT dataset-
